# paint-calculator
This program takes in the dimensions of a user's room and gives necessary information needed for the amount of paint they need. 
It will ask them for the dimensions which are the height, width and length of the room. The information given will be the area of the room, the volume and the amount of paint needed.
In this program we take the assumption that per litre of paint covers 10m^2 of paint.
